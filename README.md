ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm h4ckNinja. I work in offensive security with a focus on web and devops. I enjoy writing scripts and tools and put them here on GitHub to share as my contribution to the community in the hopes that someone finds it useful.


If you like my projects, consider [tipping me](https://ko-fi.com/h4ckninja). It helps me fund my caffeine addiction. Not required of course, but very much appreciated.
